# pyH2A

- **PyPI:** https://pypi.org/project/pyH2A
- **Documentation:** https://pyh2a.readthedocs.io
- **Source code:** https://github.com/jschneidewind/pyH2A

pyH2A is an extensible Python framework for the analysis of hydrogen production cost. Its discounted cash flow module is based on the H2A Hydrogen Analysis model developed by the [U.S. Department of Energy](https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/h2a_analysis.html)/[NREL](https://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/h2a-production-models.html).

The basic discounted cash flow analysis functionality enables calculation of levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH<sub>2</sub>). It can be interfaced with different `Plugins` to allow modelling of various hydrogen production technologies. Furthermore, different `Analysis` modules can be applied, allowing for detailed analysis of the discounted cash flow results.

It is a command line tool, with the input being provided using Markdown formatted plaintext files and the output being plots (and formatted PDF reports in the future).

Note: pyH2A is currently under development and may undergo major changes in its design.

# Installation

pyH2A can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pyH2A
```

# Documentation

Documentation for pyH2A is available at: https://pyh2a.readthedocs.io

# Dependencies

pyH2A uses Python >=3.7 with the following libraries: `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib` and `Click`

# Use

pyH2A can be used from the command line:

```bash
pyH2A run -i input_file -o output_directory
```

For example, if the input file `Input.md` is in the `../Input` directory and the output directory is `../Output/Example_Output`:

```bash
pyH2A run -i ../Input/Input.md -o ../Output/Example_Output
```

Alternatively, the `pyH2A` class from `pyH2A.run_pyH2A.py` can imported and used within a Python script.

Input is provided using a plaintext Markdown file. Input files are structured by headers (designated by '#'), which are followed by Markdown style tables. Headers and tables are parsed by `pyH2A.py` to generate dictionaries which are used for computations. Certain input sections are mandatory (such as `Technical Operating Parameters and Specifications` or `Financial Input Values`). Additional input sections can be processed by invoking `Plugins`, which perform additional calculations that feed into the discounted cash flow analysis. Finally, the input file can invoke `Analysis` modules to analyze and visualize the output.

Tools such as [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app#) can be used to edit markdown files while having a live view of the formatted version. This can help with readability of complex tables.

# Development
## Running the Application

To execute a Python script outside the `pyH2A` package, use the following command:
```bash
python3 -m path.to.file
```
This will run the script as a standalone module.

## Running Tests

pyH2A uses `pytest` for testing. To run all tests in the codebase, use:
```bash
pytest
```

To run individual tests, specify the test method within the relevant test file:
```bash
pytest tests/test_pyh2a.py::test_pv_e_base
pytest tests/test_pyh2a.py::test_pec
pytest tests/test_pyh2a.py::test_photocatalytic_base
```

You can also pass flags like `-v` for verbose output or `--maxfail` to limit the number of failures.
## Setting Up A Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jschneidewind/pyH2A.git
cd pyH2A
```
2. Install the dependencies:

For local development, it's recommended to set up a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv pyh2a_env
source pyh2a_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: pyh2a_env\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

This will install the required libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Click), along with other dependencies.

## Debugging

To debug or analyze the code, you can use the built-in Python debugger:
```bash
python -m pdb path/to/your/script.py
```
This will allow you to step through the code, inspect variables, and troubleshoot issues.

# To do

* Importing plugins and analysis modules from arbitrary location

* Enabling use of Default.md file in arbitrary location

* Block diagram illustrating flow of program

* Creation of graph showing how inputs are processed by series of plugins

* Lifecycle analysis & net energy analysis?
